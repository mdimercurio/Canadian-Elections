The goal of this project is to explore federal election data at a district level.
We will use two main datasets:

## Demographics 
[Demographics data source](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E)

Explore demographics data (mainly through visualization)
Try to cluster demographics by district to identify differences between districts. 

## Votes
[Votes data source](http://www.elections.ca/res/cir/trans2013/default.asp?prov=60&lang=e#form1)
Find districts with similar voting patterns
Evaluate significant demographics traits that influence votes for some parties
